        If a player touches one of their own pieces, they must move that piece if it has a legal move. If they touch one of their opponent's pieces, they must capture that piece if it is a legal move.
        If a player makes an illegal move (such as moving a piece in a direction it cannot move), the opponent has the option to either accept the move or have the player undo the move and make a legal move instead.
        If a player moves a piece to the opposite end of the board, they must crown it as a king before making their next move.
